# Tier 2: Revsets Section Configuration
# Advanced revset behavior settings
#
# To enable, copy desired sections to main config.toml

[revsets]
# Custom default log view (alternative to builtin)
# Show all work since trunk
# log = "trunk().."

# Show recent mutable commits
# log = "ancestors(mutable(), 10) | trunk()"

# Show visible heads with context
# log = "ancestors(visible_heads(), 3) | trunk()"

# Prioritize shorter prefixes for active work
# This makes IDs shorter for commits in your current branch
# short-prefixes = "(trunk()..@)::"

# Alternative: prioritize all mutable work
# short-prefixes = "mutable()::"

# Graph prioritization - which branch shows on left
# Useful for large merges or complex graphs
# log-graph-prioritize = "trunk()"

# Alternative: prioritize current work
# log-graph-prioritize = "@"

# Alternative: prioritize specific commit/merge
# log-graph-prioritize = "coalesce(description(exact:'megamerge'), trunk())"
