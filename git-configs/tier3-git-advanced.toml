# Tier 3: Advanced Git Configuration Settings
# Expert-level Git settings for specific use cases
#
# To enable these settings, copy desired sections to your main config.toml
# Reference: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/

[git]
# Use external git subprocess instead of libgit2
# Useful for: SSH authentication issues, credential helpers
# Trade-off: Slightly slower but more compatible
# subprocess = true

# Custom git executable path
# Use when: git not in PATH, or need specific version
# executable-path = "/opt/homebrew/bin/git"

# Sign commits on push (requires [signing] configuration)
# sign-on-push = true

# Example: Fork workflow with multiple remotes
# fetch = ["upstream", "origin"]
# push = "origin"

[signing]
# SSH commit signing (uncomment and configure when needed)
# behavior = "own"
# backend = "ssh"
# key = "ssh-ed25519 YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
# Or use key path:
# key = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"

# Lazy signing - only sign on push
# behavior = "drop"
# backend = "ssh"
# key = "ssh-ed25519 YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
