# Advanced log views

# Show only mine, unpushed work
# log = "mine() & (remote_bookmarks()..@)"

# Show visible heads with deep context
# log = "ancestors(visible_heads(), 5) | trunk()"

# Show all mutable work (can be large)
# log = "mutable() | trunk()"

# Focused view - only current branch
# log = "::@ | trunk()"

# Will Richardson's pattern - reachable mutable with context
# log = "ancestors(reachable(@, mutable()), 2)"

# Short prefix strategies

# Prioritize only current change and parents
# short-prefixes = "ancestors(@, 5)"

# Prioritize all visible heads
# short-prefixes = "visible_heads()::"

# Prioritize bookmarked commits
# short-prefixes = "bookmarks()::"

# Graph prioritization strategies

# Always show trunk on left (stable reference)
# log-graph-prioritize = "trunk()"

# Show bookmarks on left
# log-graph-prioritize = "bookmarks()"

# Show current work on left
# log-graph-prioritize = "@"

# Conditional prioritization (megamerge example)
# log-graph-prioritize = "coalesce(description(exact:'megamerge'), trunk())"

# Prioritize specific bookmark
# log-graph-prioritize = "coalesce(bookmarks(exact:'main'), trunk())"
