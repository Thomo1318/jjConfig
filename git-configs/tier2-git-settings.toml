# Tier 2: Git Configuration Settings
# Additional useful Git settings for later implementation
# 
# To enable these settings, copy desired sections to your main config.toml
# Reference: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/

[git]
# Explicitly enable colocated repos (already default, but documents intent)
colocate = true

# Default push remote (useful with multiple remotes)
push = "origin"

# Track default bookmark on clone (already default)
track-default-bookmark-on-clone = true

# Example: Multiple fetch remotes for fork workflows
# Uncomment and customize for upstream + origin workflow:
# fetch = ["upstream", "origin"]
