[revsets]
# From willhbr.net - focused on recent work
# log = "ancestors(reachable(@, mutable()), 2)"

# From community - show only unpushed
# log = "remote_bookmarks()..@"

# From community - show recent with trunk context
# log = "ancestors(mutable() & ~empty(), 5) | trunk()"

# Short prefixes for active development
# short-prefixes = "(trunk()..@)::"

# Graph prioritization examples
# log-graph-prioritize = "trunk()"
# log-graph-prioritize = "coalesce(bookmarks(), trunk())"
